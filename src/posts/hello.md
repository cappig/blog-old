Hello world! This is my first blog post :)

I'm still testing and developing this blog so the domain may change in the future. Check out all the plans I have for the blog at the [project page on github](https://github.com/cappig/blog/projects/1). All in all this blog is just a simple python script that takes a markdown article attaches a premade header and footer and generates all the html. I just wanted something super simple and this seems like a decent solution. I use [cloudflare pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) to host and deploy the site. A workflow runs the python script and commits any changes made to the files. 

So far I really like cloudflare pages. It's simple and easy to set up. It deploys and builds the site on every commit. Its all contained in the github repo and I don't need to worry about hosting the site.

Btw I'm currently using a free .ga domain, but ill register and set up a proper domain once I develop the blog a bit more.
