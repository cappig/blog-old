Yep, its been 8 months and I still havent posted a single article on my blog. So lets change that:

The holiday seson has finally arrived and this time I decided to participate in the annual [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/). Its a annual event that gives you a new programming puzzle starting form the 1st of December and going up to christmas. I've been thinking about learning rust and this seems like the perfect opportunity to do so. I'll post my solutions to the [Advent-of-code-2021](https://github.com/cappig/Advent-of-code-2021) github repo.

Happy holidays :)
