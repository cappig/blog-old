## About me

Hi, my name’s Matt and I sometimes go by Cappig. This’ll be my blog where I’ll post all sorts of stuff when I feel like it. Check out [シ.cf](http://xn--xck.cf). This domain will point to the same blog, but I just thought it would be neat to have a cool punycode domain.  
This blog is open source and all the code is avalible on [Github](https://github.com/cappig/blog).
This site also has a RSS feed, check it out [here](https://cappig.ga/feed.xml).

— Have a nice day, Matt :]
