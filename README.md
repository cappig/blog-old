# Super simple blog
![build](https://github.com/cappig/blog/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

*Code for my blog. Some stuff still needs to be improved, Im working on it. Check it out at [cappig.ga](https://cappig.ga/) or [ã‚·.cf](https://xn--xck.cf/) (both point to the same site).*

## *About*

It's a small python script that takes a markdown blog article and combines it with a html header and footer. It's super simple and minimalist. 

I made a workflow action that runs the python script and commits the changes directly to Github. This makes it so that I can publish articles and make changes directly from Github. Im hosting the website over [cloudflare pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). This makes it so that I dont need to host anything + I have the added cloudflare security.
