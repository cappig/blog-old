# My super simple blog
[![build](https://github.com/cappig/blog/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cappig/blog/actions)

*Code for my blog. Some stuff still needs to be improved, Im working on it. Check it out at [cappig.ga](https://cappig.ga/) or [ã‚·.cf](https://xn--xck.cf/) (both domain point to the same site).*

## *About*

Its a small python script that takes a markdown blog article and combines it with a html header and footer. Its super simple and minimalist. 

I made a workflow action that runs the python script and commits the changes directly to Github. This makes it so that i can publish articles and make changes directly from Github. Im hosting the website over [cloudflare pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). This makes it so that i dont need to host anything + I have the added cloudflare security.
